#Clarity Lab
Clarity Lab is a SwiftUI application designed to help students move from productivity guesswork to structured self-experimentation. The app allows users to compare two routine variations, log session data, visualize trends, and reflect on outcomes to build self-awareness.

The app follows a simple, lightweight SwiftUI architecture:
State-driven data flow using @State and @Binding
Multi-screen navigation using NavigationStack
No backend or database (in-memory data storage)
Modular view structure across separate Swift files

#Core Features
Experiment comparison (two variations per test)
Session logging (focus, energy, satisfaction)
Average focus comparison using Swift Charts
Trend visualization across sessions
Confidence score calculation
Decision screen for next steps
Reflection screen with quick tags and notes

#Technologies Used
SwiftUI
Swift Charts
NavigationStack
Declarative animations
Native haptic feedback

#Purpose
Clarity Lab promotes mindful experimentation, helping users understand which routines work best for them through data visualization and reflection.
